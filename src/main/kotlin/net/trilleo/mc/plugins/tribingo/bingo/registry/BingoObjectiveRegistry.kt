 * In-memory registry of all [BingoObjective] instances available for board
 * generation.

 * ### Code-level registration
 * ```kotlin
 * BingoObjectiveRegistry.register(MyObjective())
 * ```
 *
 * ### Event-driven objectives
 * Any [EventBingoObjective] passed to [register] is automatically registered
 * as a Bukkit event listener, so no manual `registerEvents` call is needed.
 *
 * ### Lifecycle
 * Call [init] once during plugin startup (before [register] is first invoked)
 * to provide the plugin reference needed for listener registration.
