/**
 * Abstract base for every Bingo objective.
 *
 * An objective represents a single cell on the Bingo board. Concrete subclasses
 * define the completion logic; the default [displayItem] renders the cell in
 * inventory GUIs and can be overridden to show richer information (e.g.
 * progress counters).
 *
 * ### Implementing a simple objective
 * ```kotlin
 * class HaveFullHealthObjective : BingoObjective(
 *     id          = "full_health",
 *     name        = Component.text("Full Health"),
 *     description = Component.text("Reach maximum health."),
 *     difficulty  = Difficulty.EASY
 * ) {
 *     override fun isCompletedBy(player: Player, state: BingoPlayerState) =
 *         player.health >= player.maxHealth
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * For event-driven objectives, extend [EventBingoObjective] instead.
 *
 * @param id          unique string identifier used for persistence and YAML lookups
 * @param name        display name shown in GUIs and announcements
 * @param description flavour text shown when a player clicks the cell in the GUI
 * @param difficulty  difficulty label; used for display and future board randomisation
